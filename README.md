## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

In 2012, I got acquainted with the Bulgarian GTA server called TELNET, which impressed me deeply. Since then, I had a dream of having my own game mode, and in 2014, I decided to create it on my own, using only my own scripts and resources. Although I was only 11 years old at the time, I managed to realize it to a certain extent. The development of these replicas of the game mode started several years later.

This game mode features numerous systems and over 30,000 lines of code for each version, making it a unique blend of role-play and gang warfare.

You can become a police officer/bandit, own a house/business, and much more.
